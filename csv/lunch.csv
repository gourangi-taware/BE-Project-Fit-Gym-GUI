In a large bowl add in 2 cups of whole wheat flour and some salt.Use your fingers and stir in the salt into the flour. Add little water at a time and knead to make soft, pliable paratha dough. Knead paratha dough for a couple of minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Use the fold press and knead motion to make the dough smooth.Next add a teaspoon of oil to coat the paratha dough and knead little more. You want a paratha dough that will be soft smooth and not sticky. Divide the dough into 8 to 10 equal portions. Cover the dough and allow the dough to rest until you get the filling ready.Pressure cook arbi with 1 cup water and salt for around 4 whistle and switch off the heat.Once it is pressure cooked, allow the pressure to release naturally and peel the skin.Mash the arbi into a coarse lumpy texture with your fingers or a fork.

The dough should be a bit stiff, like how you knead for puris.*To make the Dum Pukht GoshtOnce the mutton has marinated, preheat a heavy bottomed vessel or handi and add some ghee.Add the marinated mutton in the handi and saute for a few minutes till the marinated mutton leaves oil on the sides. This will take about 10 minutes. Add one glass of water and bring the Mutton gosht to a boil.Cover the handi with a lid and seal it with the wheat dough and leave the Mutton gosht cook on low heat for about 50 minutes. This process of covering and sealing the lid with the dough is called ""Dum Cooking"" - a very slow cooking process that brings in flavours to the dish.After about one hour turn off the heat and remove the dough on the lid with the help of a kitchen knife.You will notice the Dum Pukht Gosht has a rich colour and taste with all the natural oils from the the mutton released into the dish.

Spread a tablespoon of Asli Pepper cheese spreadz over the roti. I love the way the cheese spreads beautifully with ease. It makes cooking so much fun.And the best part of the cheese spreadz is that it makes a great high protein replacement for butter. It adds to the creaminess and what more the taste too.Once you have spread the cheese, add the roasted potatoes, capsicum, onions and roll it up tightly.Repeat with the remaining ingredients to make 3 more rolls. Wrap a parchment paper around each roll and serve immediately.Serve the Roasted Potato Wrap/Roll as a tea time snack with Adrak Chai, and after school snack, or a kids lunch box or even a quick weeknight dinner.
