we introduce Fitcercise, an application
that detects the user’s exercise pose counts the specified exercise
repetitions and provides personalized, detailed
recommendations on how the user can improve their form. The
application uses the MediaPipe to detect a person’s pose, and
afterwards analyses the geometry of the pose from the dataset
and real-time video and counts the repetitions of the particular
exercise.
